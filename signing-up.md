## 1.1. How do I sign up for the competition?

Goto the `#CHANNEL-NAME` channel on the club's Discord and leave a message in the pinned format. You will need your name, school email, team name, GitHub account name, and your preference for JavaScript or TypeScript.

## 1.2. How will you use my information?

Your school email will be used for communicating the git repository we will supply to you. The email will also be used for disclosing prize information after the competition is over if you win.

Otherwise, all information will only be used for helping the competition organizers run the competition.

## 1.3. How many people can sign up with me?

You can optionally sign up with someone else as a pair. In that case, you will need that person's school email and GitHub account name as well. Only one person of the pairing needs a leave the message in the sign up channel.

## 1.4. Can I quit the competition?

At any given point during the sign up timeframe you can message a competition organizer to be stricken from the competition competition.

If you request to quit during the practice tournament brackets or final touranment bracket timeframes, then you _might_ not be stricken from the roster due based on competition competition organizers' availability. In that case, your AI player will remain in the tournament roster.

## 1.5. Can I rejoin the competition?

At any given point during the sign up timeframe you can rejoin by messaging a competition organizer. This will be on a good faith basis so you _cannot_ repeatedly quit and rejoin.

If you request to rejoin during the practice touranement brackets timeframe, then your request will be handled based on the competition organizers' availability.

You will _not_ be allowed to rejoin after the practice tournament brackets are over.
