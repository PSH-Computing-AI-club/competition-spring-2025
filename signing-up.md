## 1.3. Can I sign up during the practice brackets?

Yes. If you are joining during the practice brackets timeframe please `@` an organizer in your sign-up message so that we are aware of you. The sign-up timeframe is just so we can reduce burden and do most sign-ups in bulk.

## 1.4. Do I have be enrolled as a student at Penn State Harrisburg?

Yes, we will only allow students of PSH to compete. Alternatively, you must be a student from another college or university invited as a guest by faculty or club officers.

## 1.5. Do I have to be a member of the Computing and AI Club?

No, any enrolled student of PSH can compete.

## 1.6. How will you use my information?

Your school email will be used for communicating the git repository we will supply to you. The email will also be used for disclosing prize information after the competition is over if you win.

Otherwise, all information will only be used for helping the competition organizers run the competition.

## 1.7. How many people can sign up with me?

You can optionally sign up with someone else as a pair. In that case, you will need that person's school email and GitHub account name as well. Only one person of the pairing needs a leave the message in the sign-up channel.

## 1.8. Can I quit the competition?

At any given point during the sign-up timeframe you can message a competition organizer to be stricken from the competition.

If you request to quit during the practice tournament brackets or final tournament bracket timeframes, then you _might_ not be stricken from the roster due based on competition organizers' availability. In that case, your AI player will remain in the tournament roster.

## 1.9. Can I rejoin the competition?

At any given point during the sign-up timeframe you can rejoin by using the `#competition-signup` channel on the Discord. This will be on a good faith basis so you _cannot_ repeatedly quit and rejoin.

If you request to rejoin during the practice tournament brackets timeframe, then your request will be handled based on the competition organizers' availability.

You will _not_ be allowed to rejoin after the practice tournament brackets are over.
