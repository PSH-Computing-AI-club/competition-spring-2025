## 1.1. Do I have to make my own git repository on GitHub?

No, based on your sign-up programming language preference one will be supplied to you. Your GitHub account will be invited as a contributor.

## 1.2. Why can't I make my own repository?

Our automated software that clones your git repository needs read access to your code. The simplest method of achieving that is the club's GitHub organization maintaining ownership of your git repository for the duration of the competition.

This way of handling git repositories also allows competition organizers easy access to your codebase if you require technical assistance.

## 1.3. Can I have ownership of my git repository?

Yes, after the competition is over please contact a competition organizer to have the repository transferred to your GitHub account if desired.

## 1.4. Will my git repository be public?

All competitor git repositories will be made public once the competition is over. If this is not desirable to you please contact a tournament organizer to have the repository transferred to you.

## 1.5. What git client should I use?

There are many different clients for git you can use. The standard client to use is the official [git command line client](https://git-scm.com). Since GitHub is being used as our version control platform, you can also use GitHub's official [graphical client](https://github.com/apps/desktop).

Sample Command Line Clients:

- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- [Magit](https://magit.vc)

Sample Graphical Clients:

- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client)
- [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/fleet/git-tools-overview.html)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)
